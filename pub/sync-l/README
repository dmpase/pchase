The goal here is to create a benchmark that measures the cost of testing a conteded lock. 

(1) A single, shared lock space is used across all threads. All locks in the space are locked before the test begins and each thread attempts to accquire a random lock in the space in a tight loop. A new lock is selected at random with each iteration.

(2) Same as (1), except that each thread has their own lock space that is set. 

(3) Same as (1), except that all locks are initialized to "locked", and threads acquire/release locks.
